## Overview

### Links

- [Live Site URL](https://frontend-mentor-qr-code-component-one-silk.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- TailwindCss

### What I learned

- Everything is a square. It has some margin (outside the border), some padding (inside the border), and a border itself (which can be rounded).
- Centering divs is generally as simple as the `mx-auto`

### Continued development

Tailwindcss is very useful, and the docs are incredible. I will continue practicing to more intuitively understand some of the tricks I used to get this page looking the way is does. Things such as `mx-auto` and a separate div to add top padding to the child component.
